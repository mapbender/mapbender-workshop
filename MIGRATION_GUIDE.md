# Migration Guide

## Migration to Mapbender 3.3

Check the [Mapbender Update process](https://doc.mapbender.org/en/installation/update.html).

* Make sure you have PHP >= 7.4 or PHP 8.x
* Provide a backup of your database. 
* Update your database schema to 3.3 with app/console doctrine:schema:update --force

To update from 3.2.x to 3.3.x should be quite easy.

If you update from a version < 3.2 you have to follow the steps described at section "Migration to Mapbender 3.2"

### New feature

#### Styling


Styling is now possible via variables that can be passed to your application. 

* Mapbender https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/blob/master/src/Mapbender/CoreBundle/Resources/public/sass/libs/_variables.scss
* Create your own scss file see for example https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-workshop/tree/master/src/Workshop/DemoBundle/Resources/public/demo_variables_blue.scss
* Modify your template - add function getSassVariablesAssets and refer to your scss file see for example https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-workshop/blob/master/src/Workshop/DemoBundle/Template/DemoFullscreen.php#L23


#### Sketch

* Sketch now supports to draw a circle with a defined radius. You draw the circle first and den edit the circle and define a radius.
* Sketch now allows to define colors to be offered to draw. You can also activate a color picker


#### FeatureInfo

* featureInfo Highlight now allows to style the fill and stroke and opacity


## Migration to Mapbender 3.2

You can migrate older Mapbender installations to Mapbender 3.2.

Check the [Mapbender Update process](https://doc.mapbender.org/en/installation/update.html).

* Make sure you have PHP >= 7.1.0 and PHP < 8 
* Provide a backup of your database. 
* Update your database schema to 3.2 with app/console doctrine:schema:update --force

Some elements may not work after the update and  need a closer look.

### Update map_engine_code

If it makes sense update all applications to map_engine_code cureent.

    Update mb_core_application set map_engine_code = 'current';


### SearchRouter

You find a demo at https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-workshop/blob/release/3.2/app/config/applications/mapbender_demo_nrw.yml

1. deprecated empty: use placeholder instead

2. For text and choice you have to define the full class-path.

You also find information at https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/wiki/Best-practices:-form-types#inversion-of-choices

You can update the configuration with the following SQL.

    Update mb_core_element set configuration =
    replace(configuration,'s:6:"choice"','s:53:"Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\ChoiceType"')
        where class = 'Mapbender\CoreBundle\Element\SearchRouter';

    Update mb_core_element set configuration =
    replace(configuration,'s:4:"text"','s:51:"Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\TextType"')
    where class = 'Mapbender\CoreBundle\Element\SearchRouter';

    Select configuration from mb_core_element where class = 'Mapbender\CoreBundle\Element\SearchRouter';


3. For choice: Please not that key or value are passed flipped that means value and the key- see also https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/wiki/Best-practices:-form-types#inversion-of-choices

    choices:
        Bonn - this is the value not the key: Bonn
        Cologne - this is the value not the key: Cologne
        Siegburg - this is the value not the key: Siegburg


### SimpleSearch

SimpleSearch element was improved. You can now define the projection of the result that comes from the Solr Service. Mapbender will then transform the result to the projection of the map.

SimpleSearch Supports Nominatim, Photon from version 3.2.5 - see workshop demo applications


1. Define sourceSrs in your SimpleSearch definition. If not defined the default ('EPSG:4326') be be choosen. You find an example at https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-workshop/blob/release/3.2/app/config/applications/mapbender_demo_nrw.yml

                     sourceSrs: 'EPSG:25832'

2. query_ws_replace: From version 3.2.8 on set query_ws_replace or modify the code as described in https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/issues/1391#issuecomment-968645508	     

                     query_ws_replace: +


 
### BaseSourceSwitcher

Please note that on start of an apllication all WMS are activated where the root-Layer is activated.

Before 3.2 it was possible to activate all Basesource and only the first WMS was visible on start.

* Save NULL for empty fields works for int/float/decimal columns but not for double precision (Mapbender >= 3.2.6 https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/issues/1355)

Else it can happen, that a layer is not requested for the given extent of your map.
